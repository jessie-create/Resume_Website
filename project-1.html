                <p>Introduction</p>
            </div>
                <p>It's an important topic in all countries that saving energy use and reducing pollutant emissions to increase the efficiency of economic development. Many countries try to pursue high efficiency of 
                economic development instead of high increase in GDP. Therefore, in this project, it is mainly to analyze the efficiency of economic development in some specific countries from 1990 to 2012. During the project, I hope to find the causality between GHG emissions and economy by Granger Test.
                After obtaining the relationship between GHG emissions and economy, I will find the relationship between GHG emissions and economy per capita.
            Also, the relationships between GHG emissions and different types of gases; GHG emissions and different types of industries will be analyzed by using regression models. GHG means green house gas.</p>

                <p>Descriptive Analysis and Data Visualization</p>  
            </div>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-1/graph-1.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>Firstly, I hope to find the average of economic development efficiency of the whole world from 1990 to 2012. From the above graph, we can find that there was a decrease from 1990 to 1993 but there was an huge upward trend from 1993 to 2012.</p>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-1/graph-2.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>We can choose several typical countries to do deeper analysis, so I chose China, the US and the UK. From the graph, we can see the overall tendency in these three countries clearly. Althouhg all of them have increased a lot, there were difference between them during these years. The UK had the highest ecnomic development efficiency compared with the US and China and it increased a lot when compared with its own statistics in 1990. In addition,
                China as a developing country had the slowest increase speed during these years and the growth rate was lesser than the UK and the US. However, there was a decrease from 2009 to 2010 and 2010 to 2012 in the UK. </p>
            <p>Then, I hope to find whether there were relationship between GHG per capital and GDP per capital by using Granger Causality test. The null hypothesis: the growth rate of GHG emission per capita is not the granger cause of growth rate of GDP per capita.</p>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-1/graph-3.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>From the result above, there are no significant p value which should be less than 0.05. Therefore, we can't reject the null hypothesis that the growth rate of GHG emission per capita is not the granger caouse of the growth rate of GDP per capita. Also, the null hypothesis that the growth rate of GDP per capita is not the granger cause of growth rate of GHG emission per capita can't be rejected.
                In a word, the relationship between GDP per capita and GHG emission per capita can't be found.
            </p>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-1/graph-4.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>From above, the graph is about the US from 1990 to 2012 and the p value is close to 0 which means the coefficient 0.5246 is significant and we can expalin 73.84% variation of the response varaible.</p>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-1/graph-5.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>From above graph, we can know the greenhouse gas emissions in different industries. The amount of MtCO2 in Electricity/Heat industry has increased a lot from 1990 to 2010 and the amount of MtCO2 dropped in Manufacturing/Construction and other fuel combustion around 2000 but the overall tendency increased. Therefore, the growth rate of MtCO2 in different industries had positive relationship with the economic development in China.</p>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-1/graph-6.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">

            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-1/graph-7.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>From above, we can know the emissions of different greenhouse gases in China and the US. In addition, in both two countries, the amount of CO2 was hugely bigger than other types of gases.In China, the amount of CO2 increased dramatically from 1990 to 2012 and was higher than the US in the end. However, in the US, the CO2 decreased from 2007 which might can inllustrate that the US focused on reducing pollutions that year.
                China as a developing country, it was a good time for development from 1990 to 2012 so the amount of CO2 was high per year, hope the pollution has been decreased these years.</p>

                <p>From above statistics, we can see significance in Energy(MtCO2e) which indicates that increase(decrease) 1 unit of logarithmic growth rate of energy will increase(decrease)1.0015 unit of logarithmic growth rate of CO2, and we can explain 99% of variance of the logrithmic growth rate of CO2.</p>
                <div class="project-subtitle">
                    <p>Conclusion</p>
                </div>
                <p>From this project, we can know that the relationship between GHG emissions and GDP in different industries and different countries is totally different because different countries have different national conditions, populations and national issues. As for some developed countries, the population is not an influence as for the GHG emissions. However, as for some high population developing countries, population can be an 
                    important factor which can affect the amount of GHG emissions. In addition, there's positive relationship between GDP and GHG emissions, so people should find good ways to control the amount of GHG emissions meanwhile increase the economy. For example renewable enery sources in electricy/heat industry. In addition, from different resaerches, ,the ways that namely greater resource, energy efficiency, investment in infrastructure and enhanced innovation can reduce the greenhouse gases but increase the economy. </p>
