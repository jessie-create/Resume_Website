                <p>Introduction</p>
            </div>
            <p>The dataset is about the US department employees' earnings in 2018 in Boston. I mainly focus on what factors that affect total earnings in Boston in 2018 to improve the satisfaction of future job seekers.</p>>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-4/graph-1.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-4/graph-2.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>From above,we can know that the toppest department is Boston Police department which had average total earning of $131,321. The second one is Boston Fire Department which had $130,293 and it was very close to the average salary of BPD.
                    There's no doubt that BFD and BFD staff experiences high-risk duties so they deserve to have higher  remuneration. The remaining statistics was much lower than BPD and BFD and even lower than half of BPD and BFD. </p>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-4/graph-3.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>From the graph, we can know the ranking of salary for different types of job title. The top 3 job title is Polie Detective, Police Officer and Fire Fighter, and some jobs in education industry was also in the list such as Teacher and Subsitute Teach. The last several job titles might be part-time so the average was much lower.</p>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-4/graph-4.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>As we can see, people who had high salary in 2018 living in the southwestern area which belongs to Suffolk County.Also, people lived in West Roxbury (zipcode:02132) had the highest average salary, we might can guess there were many police or fire fighters living in this area in 2018. Therefore, I believe that some luxury brands and supermarkets can have more profits if they choose to open in these areas.  </p>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-4/graph-5.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>In above graph, I counducted K-mens clustering on overtime and total earning, overtime represents overtime wage. There are 4 clusters showing in the graph, and we can see strong positive correlation between overtime and total earning, so overtime can be an important factor towards total earning.</p>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-4/graph-6.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>From above, we can know that tehre were 3,173 employees working for BPD in 2018 which was the most. In addition, BFD had 1,688 employees in 2018. </p>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-4/graph-7.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>Above is the boxplot about Boston Police Department, the maximum in BPD was $684,411 and the minimum was $105.9 with an average was $131,322. Also, there were more outliers in Injured, Detail and Other earnings.</p>
            <p>Regular Salary and Total Earnings in BPD</p>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-4/graph-8.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>From above we can know that p value is smaller than 0.05 so the resulte is important. Also, the correlation between regualr salary and total earnings is positive. More adjusted R-squared, the better of the statistics and models.</p>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-4/graph-9.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>From above, we can know that most of points fall on the line, so most of them approximately from a normal distribution.</p>
            <p>Other Salary and Total Earnings</p>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-4/graph-10.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>From above, the correlation about total earnings and other salary is positive but the adjusted R-squared is only 0.1247, so other salary can't be a top covariate. However, the statistics is still important because p value is smaller than 0.05. From the comparision of regular salary and other salary with total earnings, regular salary is more important.</p>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-4/graph-11.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>Scale Location Plot can illustrate the range of points in the predictive range. From above, we can know that after 4e+05, the points are far from each other, so the red line goes up and the graph is heteroscedastic.</p>
            <p>Injured Salary and Total Earnings</p>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-4/graph-12.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>From above, , we can know that the intercept is smaller than 0, so the correlation between injured salary and total earnins is negative. In addition, the adjusted R-squared is smaller than 0, so injured salary can’t be an imporatn covariate. It might because if the staff are injured, they only can call in sick and they can’t work. Therefore, they won’t obtain usual total earnings.</p>
            <div class="graphs">
                <img src="image/project-4/graph-13.jpg" class="project-graphs" width="60%">
            </div>
            <p>From above, we can see that most of the residuals are normal distribution except points 5 and 10. So, the residuals of the injured salary model can pass the test of normality.</p>
            <div class="project-subtitle">
                <p>Conclusion</p>
            </div>
            <p>The analysis of the project can help us a lot to solve problems that which department have higher total earnings, people live in which zip codes tend to earn more salary and the correlation between several important variables and the total earnings in top departments etc. In addition, the analysis of the Boston Police Department helps us to know which variables are important towards total earnings.</p>
